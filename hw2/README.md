Due Friday, September 13, 11:59pm

In this second homework assignment, you'll use SASyLF to prove some lemmas about
analysis for a subset of TypeScript.

## Install SASyLF

You should already have SASyLF installed; if not, refer to the instructions in
Recitation 2.

## Assignment structure

The structure of this assignment mirrors the structure of Recitation 2.

## Import into Eclipse

Use the same steps as in Recitation 2.

## Exercise

Fill in all missing proofs in `slf/edu/cmu/cs/plp/hw2.slf`; when you're done,
Eclipse / VSCode should give you no errors or warnings for that file.

## Submit

Simply submit your `hw2.slf` file.
